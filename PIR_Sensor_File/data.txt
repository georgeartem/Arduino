It is plug-and-play with Vex, so I thought I'd post and share the goodness. It has a 3-pin connector that you can plug a servo extender into and the pinout is correct for Vex.

Attached to a digital port, it reads 0 until it senses motion in its field of view (about a 90 degree cone). The output remains high until a few seconds after the motion stops, then it returns to 0. (There is a jumper that configures it to pulse the whole time it is sensing motion, if you prefer.) You have to let it self-calibrate after you first power it on, so it won't stabilize until 30s or so after you power it on.

It has two small holes for mounting, but they don't conform to Vex sizes or spacing, of course.

Obviously, it'll trigger continuously wile your bot is in motion, but it could be useful for a sentry bot that sits idle until it detects movement.
